# Angular Components

This is an agular application I built in order to learn how to use multiple components in an application and nest them.
The components are separated in different modules, which are imported in the router file in order to switch between pages.

# Production server

# Comps

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
